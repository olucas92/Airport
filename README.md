<h1> Airport Challenge </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>
Simple airport challenge for the first week at Makers Academy. Planes can take off and land in the airports,
affecting the plane count. Planes cannot land or take off if the weather is stormy. Planes also cannot land
if the airport has reached its maximum capacity.
All done through TDD and using Object Oriented Design.
